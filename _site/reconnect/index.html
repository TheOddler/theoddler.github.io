<h2 id="reconnect">ReConnect</h2>

<p>ReConnect is our entry for the Microsoft Imagine Cup 2011. It was made by <a href="http://www.3dstevendemeyer.com/">Steven De Meyer</a> and <a href="http://elieverbrugge.com/">Elie Verbrugge</a> as 3D artists, <a href="http://www.thijsmorlion.com/">Thijs Morlion</a> and myself as programmers.</p>

<h3 id="game">Game</h3>

<p>The game is about rebuilding the world. For the Imagine Cup we had to make a game about the toughest problems in the world. We choose hunger, poverty and polution. These problems literally destroyed the world in our game, and itâ€™s your task to reconnect the pieces and rebuilding the world.</p>

<p>It was made in XNA, since this is a competition of Microsoft, for both Windows and Windows Phone 7.</p>

<p>We managed to get in the semi-finals for both Games for Windows and Games for Windows Phone 7.</p>
