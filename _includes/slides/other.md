### Risk of Thrones

Risk of Thrones (shown above) is a huge, 1.2m by 1.6m, Risk board I made as a birthday present for my sister.

The board is based on the map of the Game of Thrones world, and includes some special places with interesting new rules. It's open-source and you can [check it out here](http://theoddler.github.io/RiskOfThrones/).

I also made a little [companion app](http://theoddler.github.io/RiskOfThrones/companion/) that automatically divides the world up for the start of the game.

### Liquid

Liquid is a water simulation in Unity. It runs entirely on the CPU, but is fully multithreaded so it runs very smooth. Check out my [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/2a5h3q/realtime_water_simulation_v2/) for some more information, or [play it here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10448192/Liquid/Webplayer%20Publish%20V2%20-%20Multithreaded/Webplayer.html) if you still have the Unity webplayer installed.

### Pokédex

A simple Pokédex made in [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/), using [Pokéapi](http://pokeapi.co/) for all the data. It shows basic type information for use during a battle. I found other sites to show way too much information, while most of the time I only want to know which moves are super effective. You can [try it out here](http://theoddler.github.io/pokedex/) or view the source code [here](https://github.com/theoddler/pokedex).
