## Our entry for Imagine Cup 2011

ReConnect is a game about connecting and combining islands to rebuild the world. It was made by [Steven De Meyer](http://www.3dstevendemeyer.com/), [Thijs Morlion](http://www.thijsmorlion.com/), [Elie Verbrugge](http://zornxiv.blogspot.com/) and myself as entry for the Imagine Cup 2011. We finished in the half-finales.

ReConnect was developed in about four months, from nothing to concept to fully playable game and this while still having a lot of other school-work to do. Since ReConnect was our entry for the Imagine Cup 2011 it was made with XNA for Microsof Windows.
