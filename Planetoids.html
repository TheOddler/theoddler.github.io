				<p>For my exams of my first year of DAE I had to remake a classic game. It was for my maths & physics class so graphics weren't that important. I chose to remake Asteroids, but give it my own spin. I added my own controlls and upgraded the spaceship's laser.</p>
	            <p>Then years later I decided to remake Planetoids. I first used WebGL for it's graphics, though later decided to use the HTML5 canvas instead. Now Planetoids is fully playable in any browser.</p>
	            <p class="slide_content_title">Physics</p>
	            <p>In the original I wrote all physics myself, they were very basic, glitchy and really rough. Rocks couldn't turn, and their collision wasn't very good, but still for a first year programmer not bad at all. Now for the remake I decided to use an external library: <a href="https://code.google.com/p/box2dweb/">Box2D Web</a>. A javascript version of the Box2D physics engine. This gives much nicer physics and reduced the code I had to write myself.</p>
	            <p class="slide_content_title">Graphics</p>
	            <p>For graphics, in the original, I used the engine of my teacher, Kevin Hoefman, it was very basic but more than enough when only using vector graphics. For the remake I use the HTML5 canvis, without any additional libraries.</p>
