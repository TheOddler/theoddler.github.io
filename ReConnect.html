				<p>ReConnect is our entry for the Microsoft Imagine Cup 2011. It was made by <a href="http://www.3dstevendemeyer.com/">Steven De Meyer</a> and <a href="http://elieverbrugge.com/">Elie Verbrugge</a> as 3D artists, <a href="http://www.thijsmorlion.com/">Thijs Morlion</a> and myself as programmers.</p>
				<p class="slide_content_title">Game</p>
				<p>The game is about rebuilding the world. For the Imagine Cup we had to make a game about the toughest problems in the world. We choose hunger, poverty and polution. These problems literally destroyed the world in our game, and it's your task to reconnect the pieces and rebuilding the world.</p>
				<p>It was made in XNA, since this is a competition of Microsoft, for both Windows and Windows Phone 7.</p>
				<p>We managed to get in the semi-finals for both Games for Windows and Games for Windows Phone 7.</p>
				<p>You can <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10448192/Pablo%27s%20Site/Game%20Downloads/ReConnect/ReConnect-%20Installer.rar" title="ReConnect - Installer">download the installer here</a> and play the game yourself.</p>
