## Three-dimensional

Concerning 3D, I'm well rounded, but not an expert in anything. I have a basic knowledge of both low- and high-poly modeling, both subdivision and sculpting. I also know what diffuse, specular, glossiness, height, bump and normal maps are and how to make and use them. Even rigging, skinning and animation are aspects of 3D I know. As well as some knowledge of both particles and materials in UDK.

You won't find the best 3D-artist in me, though I do know how to talk to people that are.
