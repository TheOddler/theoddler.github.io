		<h2>A brilliant turn-based strategy game</h2>
		<p>Master Wars is a little project I'm working on. At the moment it's just me working on it, though I'm looking for a 3D artist to help me with the art. It's a Turn-Based Strategy game, based on Advance Wars, but it takes place on actual planets. I'm making it in Unity for PC/Mac and playing around with touch-input. It's in the pre-alpha stage.</p>
