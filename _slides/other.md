### Risk of Thrones

Risk of Thrones (shown above) is a huge, 1.2m by 1.6m, Risk board I made as a birthday present for my sister.

The board is based on the map of the Game of Thrones world, and includes some special places with interesting new rules. It's open-source and you can [check it out here](http://theoddler.github.io/RiskOfThrones/).

I also made a little [companion app](http://theoddler.github.io/RiskOfThrones/companion/) that automatically divides the world up for the start of the game.

### Liquid

*Liquid* is a water and erosion simulation in Unity. 
The latest version runs entirely on the GPU for a very fast simulation, though still requires a proper graphics card.
[Check it out here]({{site.baseurl}}/liquid/WebGL/).

An older version ran on the CPU, but was fully multithreaded so it ran very smooth. Check out my [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/2a5h3q/realtime_water_simulation_v2/) for some more information.

### Pokédex

A simple Pokédex made in [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/), using [Pokéapi](http://pokeapi.co/) for all the data. It shows basic type information for use during a battle. I found other sites to show way too much information, while most of the time I only want to know which moves are super effective. You can [try it out here](http://theoddler.github.io/pokedex/) or view the source code [here](https://github.com/theoddler/pokedex).
