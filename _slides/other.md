### [Risk of Thrones](http://theoddler.github.io/RiskOfThrones/)

Risk of Thrones (shown above) is a huge, 1.2m by 1.6m, Risk board I made as a birthday present for my sister.

The board is based on the map of the Game of Thrones world, and includes some special places with interesting new rules. It's open-source and you can [check it out here](http://theoddler.github.io/RiskOfThrones/).

I also made a little [companion app](http://theoddler.github.io/RiskOfThrones/companion/) that automatically divides the world up for the start of the game.

### [Pokédex](http://pokedex.pabloproductions.be/)

A simple Pokédex made in [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/). It shows basic type information for use during a battle. I found other sites to show way too much information, while most of the time I only want to know which moves are super effective. You can [try it out here](http://pokedex.pabloproductions.be/) or view the source code [here](https://gitlab.com/TheOddler/pokedex).

### [Magic Tools](http://mtg.pabloproductions.be)

A web-app that provides coins, dice and counters to be used while playing the card-game MTG.
I, in part, made it as a way to test and research Angular, React and Vue.
I tried all three, and in the end decided to use Vue for this project, as it seemed to combine the pros of the other two.

### [ReConnect]({{site.baseurl}}/reconnect/)

ReConnect is a game about connecting and combining islands to rebuild the world.
It was made by [Steven De Meyer](http://www.3dstevendemeyer.com/), [Thijs Morlion](http://www.thijsmorlion.com/), [Elie Verbrugge](http://zornxiv.blogspot.com/) and myself as entry for the Imagine Cup 2011.
We finished in the semi-finales.
