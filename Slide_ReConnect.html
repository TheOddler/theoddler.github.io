	        <p>ReConnect is a game about connecting and combining islands to rebuild the world. It was made by <a href="//vimeo.com/user7016680">Steven De Meyer</a>, <a href="//www.thijsmorlion.com/">Thijs Morlion</a>, <a href="//zornxiv.blogspot.com/">Elie Verbrugge</a> and myself as entry for the Imagine Cup 2011. We finished in the half-finales.</p>
	        <p>ReConnect was developed in about four months, from nothing to concept to fully playable game and this while still having a lot of other school-work to do. Since ReConnect was our entry for the Imagine Cup 2011 it was made with XNA for Microsof Windows.</p>
