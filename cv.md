# Career profile

Senior Backend Developer and Manager with a demonstrated history across a variety of programming languages such as C#, PHP, SQL, and most recently Haskell. My focus has been backend development, but I also successfully led and managed both development and design teams. No matter my position on a team, I focus on bringing the best out of my colleagues by sharing knowledge and providing support, as well as listening to others' expertise so we can all do our best work together.
