## A brilliant turn-based strategy game

War Systems is a project I'm working on in my spare time. For the moment it's mainly a learning exercise I've been doing over the past several years, redesigning it whenever I see fit. I've restarted with a clean code-base several times, each time improving it and applying new things I learned in college.

It's a Turn-Based Strategy game, based on Advance Wars, but it takes place on actual planets. I'm making it in Unity for PC/Mac and playing around with touch-input and WebGL. The most recently restart of the project is focussing on a full undo/redo system, as well as both sync and async networked multiplayer.
