description: A mobile-first responsive website to collect my recipes
long_description: |
    A simple, no nonsense website to collect all my recipes.
    Features include a no-sleep button to keep the screen awake during cooking, and tick-marks with each recipe-step, as well as proper printing support.
    Built on [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for responsiveness, and using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) as a static website generator.
    It has a [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) backend for easy content management, and makes use of [GitLab Continuous Integration/Delivery (CI/CD)](https://about.gitlab.com/product/continuous-integration/) for automatic builds and deployment as a static website on [GitLab Pages](https://about.gitlab.com/product/pages/).
