long_description: |
    The website for the Belgian artist [Marie Julia Bollansée](https://www.mariejuliabollansee.be/), she also happens to be my mother.
    The website uses completely custom CSS using modern features such as [grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) and [flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout) for clean and responsive layouting.
    It also has a [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) backend for easy content management, and makes use of [GitLab Continuous Integration/Delivery (CI/CD)](https://about.gitlab.com/product/continuous-integration/) for automatic builds and deployment as a static website on [GitLab Pages](https://about.gitlab.com/product/pages/).
