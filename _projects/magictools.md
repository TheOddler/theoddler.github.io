description: A web-app build in Vue to be used while playing MTG
long_description: |
    A web-app that provides coins, dice and counters to be used while playing the card-game MTG.
    I, in part, made it as a way to test and research [Angular](https://angular.io/), [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/).
    I tried all three, and in the end decided to use [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) for this project, as it seemed to combine the pros of the other two.
