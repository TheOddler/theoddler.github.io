description: A web-app build in Vue to be used while playing MTG
---

A web-app that provides coins, dice and counters to be used while playing the card-game MTG.
I, in part, made it as a way to test and research Angular, React and Vue.
I tried all three, and in the end decided to use Vue for this project, as it seemed to combine the pros of the other two.
