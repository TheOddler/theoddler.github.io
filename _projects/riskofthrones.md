    Risk of Thrones (shown above) is a huge, 1.2m by 1.6m, Risk board I made as a birthday present for my sister.

    The board is based on the map of the Game of Thrones world, and includes some special places with interesting new rules.
    It's open-source and you can [check it out here](https://www.pabloproductions.be/RiskOfThrones/).

    I also made a little [companion app](https://www.pabloproductions.be/RiskOfThrones/companion/) that automatically divides the world up for the start of the game.
