    ReConnect is a game about connecting and combining islands to rebuild the world.
    It was made by [Steven De Meyer](http://www.3dstevendemeyer.com/), [Thijs Morlion](http://www.thijsmorlion.com/), [Elie Verbrugge](http://zornxiv.blogspot.com/) and myself as entry for the Imagine Cup 2011.
    We finished in the semi-finales.
